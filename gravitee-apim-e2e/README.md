# Gravitee APIM e2e

This folder contains the integration tests of Gravitee.io API Management.

They are based on Cypress and Jest and can be run against a locally running APIM Rest API.


## Getting Started

First you need to install the dependencies & build test:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

Then, the following NPM scripts are available:
 - `npm run test:ui`: Run the APIM stack and the cypress UI tests in docker ([more details](./docker/ui-tests/README.md))
 - `npm run test:ui:dev`: Run the cypress UI tests against a locally running APIM
 - `npm run test:api`: Run the APIM stack and the jest API tests in docker ([more details](./docker/api-tests/README.md))
 - `npm run test:api:dev`: Run the jest API tests against a locally running APIM
 - `npm run apim:serve`: Run the APIM stack in docker with last apim release by default in order to run tests locally from your IDE.  
   To run with latest master use this env-var `APIM_REGISTRY=graviteeio.azurecr.io APIM_TAG=master-latest npm run apim:serve`
 - `npm run apim:clean`: Stop and remove the containers & volumes.
 - `npm run bulk`: Run jest bulk scripts to create data to local environment
   - You can pass some options like `npm run bulk -- --apis=50 --applications=5`, available options:
       - apis (number): The number of APis to create
       - applications (number): The number of applications to create
       - skipStart (boolean): to not start created APIs
       - skipDeploy (boolean): to not deploy created APIs
       - skipSubscriptions (boolean): to not create subscriptions between APIs and applications
       - skipRatings (boolean): to not rate the APIs

## About management API client 

This project use project https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator[openapi-generator] to generate a client sdk with openapi file.
If you want to generate the client for management API, start the management rest-api locally and run `npm run update:sdk:management`
If you want to generate the client for portal API, just run `npm run update:sdk:portal`
