# Customize your notification templates

Here you can find all the templates used when notifications are triggered in the platform as well as email templates used for specific actions.

Templates are grouped by category:
* API
* Application
* Portal
* Templates for action

In the last category **Templates to include**, you can find all html templates that can be included in others email templates. (e.g. `header.html`)

Click on a template to edit a portal and/or an email notification.

When a portal or an email notification has been customized, a `CUSTOM` label is added to the template name.
