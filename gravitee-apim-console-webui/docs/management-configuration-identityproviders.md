# Identity providers

By activating identity provider, you are providing capabilities to users to login into the portal / management-ui using
external user accounts from GitHub, Google, OpenID Connect server or Gravitee.io AM.

You can activate as many identity providers as you need. Groups and roles will be automatically assigned to users depending on the identity provider used and how it has been configured.

Identity providers can be managed at organization level.
