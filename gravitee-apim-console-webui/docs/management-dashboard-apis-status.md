# APIs Status

Health monitoring of your APIs by sending requests to an `health` endpoint on each API.

The API backend should perform the necessary checks by providing some probes and return an indication of its status.

You can hide or show APIs which do not have any health-check configuration.

You can click the `View detail` link on a card to navigate to the health-check page of a specific API.
